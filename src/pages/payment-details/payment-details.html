      		<h1 text-center>How secure payments work</h1>
	 		<p text-center>
	 			If you want to pay and secure a room / apartment, the best way is to press on the shopping cart icon or by going to the <strong>' deposit '</strong> tab and pressing on the <strong>' Deposit/EFT '</strong> button and you will be guided through. 
	 		</p>
	 		<p text-center>
	 		The app will guide you through the process of transferring funds into the Metalojiq Solutions (Pty)Ltd bank account (Clickinn's parent company)
	 		</p>
	 		<p text-center>
	 		At the end, the tenant will confirm once they have successfully moved into the apartment and will be prompted to fill in the banking details of the landlord (as they appear on the contract which the tenant signs). Finally the app will direct the funds appropriately to the landlord and the agent if any agent was involved.
	 		</p>
	 		<p text-center>
	 			If any dispute arises before the tenant confirms that they have moved in, they can request a refund and Clickinn will make a refund with a penalty of 5% of the monies refunded, or they can redirect the funds towards securing another place. 
	 		</p>
	 		<h2 text-center>Security logic of this system</h2>
	 		<p text-center>
	 			Because funds transfers are only between the user and Clickinn, the chances of money being transferred into a scammers bank account are greatly reduced and the users money is kept in a neutral account up until the user confirms that they have moved in and also furnish us with the landlords banking details. After the user has confirmed their move-in, we release funds directed to the landlord nd agent if an agent was involved in the apartment securing.
	 			
	 		</p>
	 		<p text-center>
	 			In conclusion system protects the accommodation seeker from sending money into scammers accounts and it also creates an opportunity for anyone to make money as an accommodation agent through Clickinn.
